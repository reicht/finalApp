# Final Iron Yard Project - Take 2
## Doogle

The intent of this project is to produce a site capable of displaying pups available through
rescue organizations, sortable and filterable by distance, breeds, traits, etc.

Ideally an API will be integrated and allow for nationwide search, failing ability to
work with an API test data may be plopped instead.

Breed listings and traits will be taken from the AKC listings, and their standard will be
used to grant a strong basis for inclusion, grouping, and traits.
